objectives:
  - Establish minimum governance under total loss conditions
  - Restore repository and registry access
  - Re-activate detection and handoff systems safely
authority_boundaries: [read, analyze, recommend]
preconditions:
  - "Repository access unknown"
  - "Governance registry status unknown"
procedures:
  - name: Stage 1A - Repository Access Validation
    steps:
      - "Attempt to load governance registry from canonical URL"
      - "If fail, request pasted registry content"
      - "Record anchor: repository_access, governance_registry_loaded"
  - name: Stage 1B - Governance Anchor Establishment
    steps:
      - "Compute registry checksum if loaded"
      - "Set zero_assumption_discipline: ENFORCED"
      - "Set framework_modification: PROHIBITED"
      - "Confirm authority_boundaries: [read, analyze, recommend]"
  - name: Stage 2 - Framework Files Loading
    steps:
      - "Load mandatory files: governance_registry.yaml, universal_wrapper.md, breadcrumbs.yaml, detection_patterns.yaml"
      - "Halt on policy violations"
  - name: Stage 3 - Node System Activation
    steps:
      - "Validate routing with a known test query"
      - "Check cross-references and schema compliance"
  - name: Stage 4 - Operational Handoff
    steps:
      - "Generate minimal compliant handoff"
      - "Record governance anchor for audit"
anchors:
  mandatory:
    current_stage: "<1|2|3|4>"
    governance_status: "<operational|degraded|recovery_mode>"
    repository_connection: "<active|failed|partial>"
    framework_compliance: "<full|limited|emergency>"
    authority_boundaries: "<confirmed|requires_validation>"
