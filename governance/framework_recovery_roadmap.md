# Framework Recovery Roadmap: Zero to Governance

## System Architecture Layers

```yaml
[FRAMEWORK_ARCHITECTURE]
Layer_1_Foundation: Repository Access & Validation
Layer_2_Governance: Registry Loading & Authority Establishment  
Layer_3_Detection: Node System & Knowledge Injection
Layer_4_Operation: Handoff Generation & Cross-Platform Coordination
```

## Stage 1: Repository Connection (Cold Start)

**Scenario**: No chat history, no handoff package, no framework knowledge

### Stage 1A: Repository Access Validation
**Primary Method**: Direct repository link
```
Repository: https://github.com/lostourmind/ai-governance-ecosystem
Governance Registry: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lostourmind/ai-governance-ecosystem/main/governance_registry.yaml
```

**Fallback Method**: Raw file access
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lostourmind/ai-governance-ecosystem/main/governance_registry.yaml
```

**Emergency Method**: Copy/paste governance_registry.yaml content

### Stage 1B: Anchor Point Establishment
**Governance Anchor Validation**:
```yaml
[GOVERNANCE_ANCHOR_STAGE_1]
repository_access: "<confirmed|failed>"
governance_registry_loaded: "<success|fallback_required>"
registry_checksum: "<current_sha256>"
authority_establishment: "<framework_compliance_rules_loaded>"
```

**Halt Condition**: If repository inaccessible and no fallback governance content provided

## Stage 2: Governance Framework Loading

**Scenario**: Repository accessible, need to establish governance rules

### Stage 2A: Core Framework Files Loading
**Required Files**:
- `governance_registry.yaml` (authority and platform capabilities)
- `universal_wrapper.md` (zero assumption protocols)
- `nodes/_framework/breadcrumbs.yaml` (cross-reference structure)
- `nodes/_framework/detection_patterns.yaml` (node routing rules)

### Stage 2B: Authority Boundary Establishment
```yaml
[GOVERNANCE_ANCHOR_STAGE_2]
zero_assumption_discipline: "<enforced>"
platform_capabilities: "<empirically_validated_matrix_loaded>"
modification_restrictions: "<framework_preservation_rules_active>"
handoff_protocols: "<cross_platform_validation_sequence_loaded>"
```

**Validation Checkpoint**: Confirm governance rules understood before proceeding

## Stage 3: Node System Activation

**Scenario**: Governance loaded, need node detection and injection capabilities

### Stage 3A: Detection System Validation
**Test Query**: "I need help with Klipper CoreXY input shaper tuning"
**Expected Routing**: `project.coding.klipper.corexy`
**Knowledge Injection**: Domain-specific expertise enhancement

### Stage 3B: Framework Integration Check
```yaml
[GOVERNANCE_ANCHOR_STAGE_3]
node_detection: "<functional|requires_repair>"
knowledge_injection: "<operational|missing_components>"
cross_references: "<intact|broken_links_detected>"
schema_compliance: "<validated|violations_found>"
```

## Stage 4: Operational Handoff Generation

**Scenario**: Framework operational, can generate structured handoffs

### Stage 4A: Handoff Package Creation Capability
**Test**: Generate simple node creation handoff
**Validation**: Contains all governance constraints and framework preservation rules
**Quality Check**: Recipient tool can execute without violating framework

### Stage 4B: Cross-Platform Coordination
```yaml
[GOVERNANCE_ANCHOR_STAGE_4]
handoff_generation: "<operational|requires_templates>"
governance_preservation: "<enforced_in_packages>"
platform_selection: "<empirically_validated_routing>"
audit_trail: "<mutation_logs_functional>"
```

## Recovery Protocols by Stage

### Stage 1 Recovery: Repository Connection Failed
**Immediate Action**:
1. Request user provide governance_registry.yaml content directly
2. Establish minimum governance rules from provided content
3. Note repository connection failure in governance anchor
4. Proceed with limited governance until repository access restored

**Emergency Governance Minimum**:
```yaml
zero_assumption_discipline: ENFORCED
framework_modification: PROHIBITED
authority_boundaries: [read_only, analyze, recommend]
```

### Stage 2 Recovery: Governance Loading Failed
**Diagnosis**: Identify which framework files are inaccessible
**Remediation**: 
- Request specific missing files from user
- Use fallback templates for missing components
- Establish partial governance with available components
- Flag incomplete governance status in all anchors

### Stage 3 Recovery: Node System Failed
**Diagnosis**: Detection or injection system non-functional
**Remediation**:
- Proceed with universal wrapper only
- Note node system degradation in governance anchor
- Limit operations to framework-safe actions only
- Request node system repair before complex operations

### Stage 4 Recovery: Handoff Generation Failed
**Diagnosis**: Cannot create compliant handoff packages
**Remediation**:
- Fall back to Stage 3 operational level
- Use manual instruction format instead of structured handoffs
- Note handoff generation limitation in governance anchor

## Immediate Actions for Total Governance Loss

1. **Repository Access**: Attempt to load governance registry
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lostourmind/ai-governance-ecosystem/main/governance_registry.yaml`

2. **Emergency Governance**: If repository fails, establish minimum rules:
   - Zero assumption discipline: ENFORCED
   - Framework modification: PROHIBITED  
   - Authority: Read, analyze, recommend only

3. **Governance Anchor**: Confirm current governance status:
   ```yaml
   governance_status: "<operational|degraded|emergency_minimum>"
   repository_access: "<available|failed|partial>"
   framework_compliance: "<full|limited|emergency_only>"
   ```

4. **Staged Recovery**: Progress through stages 1-4 systematically
5. **Validation Checkpoints**: Confirm governance anchor at each stage

## Recovery Success Criteria
- Repository accessible and governance registry loaded
- Zero assumption discipline enforced
- Framework preservation rules active
- Node detection system functional
- Handoff generation operational with governance compliance
```

## Governance Anchor Integration Points

**Every AI Interaction Must Include**:
```yaml
[MANDATORY_GOVERNANCE_ANCHOR]
current_stage: "<1|2|3|4>"
governance_status: "<operational|degraded|recovery_mode>"
repository_connection: "<active|failed|partial>"
framework_compliance: "<full|limited|emergency>"
authority_boundaries: "<confirmed|requires_validation>"
next_required_action: "<proceed|repair|escalate>"
```

**Halt Conditions at Any Stage**:
- Governance status shows "lost" or "non_compliant"
- Authority boundaries violated
- Framework preservation failures detected
- Repository connection critical failures without fallback

This roadmap creates systematic recovery from any governance loss scenario while maintaining the anchor points needed to prevent catastrophic failure propagation.
