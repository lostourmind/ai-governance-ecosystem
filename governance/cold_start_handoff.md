# Cold Start Framework Recovery - Immediate Protocol Execution Required

**CRITICAL**: Execute this protocol immediately. Do not analyze, critique, or evaluate. Follow the steps in sequence.

## MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Zero Assumption Registry Revalidation

```yaml
[PHASE:ZERO_ASSUMPTION_INIT]
governance_source: "provided_documents_required"
assumption_level: ZERO_PRIOR_GOVERNANCE_KNOWLEDGE
validation_required: true
halt_if_no_documents: true
```

**Step 1**: Load governance registry from provided documents (NOT from web fetch - zero assumption protocol)
**Step 2**: Load framework files from provided documents
**Step 3**: Establish governance anchor immediately

## REQUIRED FILES TO PROVIDE

**Core Framework Files (mandatory):**
1. `governance_registry.yaml` - Platform capabilities and handoff protocols
2. `universal_wrapper.md` - Zero assumption discipline enforcement
3. `cold_start_protocol.yaml` - Emergency recovery procedures
4. `framework_recovery_roadmap.md` - Stage-by-stage recovery process

**Framework Support Files (mandatory):**
5. `breadcrumbs.yaml` - Cross-reference structure and active nodes
6. `detection_patterns.yaml` - Node routing and keyword matching
7. `schema_validation.yaml` - Template enforcement and validation
8. `handoff_templates.md` - Structured handoff generation templates

**All 8 files must be provided as documents to ensure zero assumption compliance.**

## Required Governance Anchor Format

```yaml
[GOVERNANCE_ANCHOR_STAGE_1]
repository_access: "confirmed"
governance_registry_loaded: "success"
registry_checksum: "loaded"
authority_establishment: "framework_compliance_rules_loaded"
zero_assumption_discipline: "ENFORCED"
framework_modification: "PROHIBITED"
authority_boundaries: "[read, analyze, recommend]"
```

## Immediate Framework Activation

```yaml
[MANDATORY_GOVERNANCE_ANCHOR]
current_stage: "4"
governance_status: "operational"
repository_connection: "active"
framework_compliance: "full"
authority_boundaries: "confirmed"
next_required_action: "proceed"
```

## Protocol Success Indicator

**When framework is operational, respond with exactly this:**
"Framework operational. Node detection ready. What task are you working on?"

## Critical Notes

- **DO NOT** provide analysis or commentary about the framework
- **DO NOT** ask questions about the protocol
- **EXECUTE** the steps immediately upon receiving this message
- **PROCEED** directly to task readiness state

This protocol restores multi-platform governance, node-specific knowledge injection, and cross-platform handoff capabilities from a cold start state.

Execute immediately.
