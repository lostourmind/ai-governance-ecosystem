# Project Coding SQL DOMO

This node packages DOMO BI implementation guidance under strict governance.

## Contents
- `node.yaml` — registry-compliant metadata (template exact).
- `constraints.yaml` — prohibited fields and validation rules.
- `knowledge_base.yaml` — domain expertise and project patterns.
- `supplement_prompt.md` — execution checklist and standards.
- `README.md` — overview.

## Usage
1. Keep `node.yaml` unchanged except timestamp if needed.
2. Build ETL and dashboards following `supplement_prompt.md`.
3. Reference patterns in `knowledge_base.yaml`.
4. Validate with `constraints.yaml` before merge.

## Compliance
- No edits to framework files or structure.
- No prohibited fields.
- Breadcrumbs and checksums match governance registry.
