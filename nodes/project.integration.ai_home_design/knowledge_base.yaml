  - "Quotation service connection: area takeoff, material schedules, and auto-BOM generation."
  - "SSO (OAuth2/OIDC) and role-based access for designers, clients, and vendors."
  - "Export pipelines to AR (USDZ on iOS, GLB for Android) and to CAD (STEP/DWG references)."

ai_home_design_visualization_optimization:
  - "Progressive asset streaming, mesh LOD, and instance rendering; texture compression (KTX2/BasisU)."
  - "BVH acceleration structures and tiled loading for large scenes; frustum and occlusion culling."
  - "GPU memory budgeting and texture atlasing to minimize state changes."
  - "Edge caching via CDN for assets and HDRIs; WASM workers for geometry ops."
