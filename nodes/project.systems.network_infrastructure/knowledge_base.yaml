  description: Network device identification, DNS optimization, DHCP/VLAN/IPAM practices, and data integration for asset tracking.

platform_constraints:
  - Use least-privilege for AD, WMI, and SNMPv3.
  - Discovery from management subnets only.
  - Prefer IPAM as source of truth for A/PTR creation.
  - Enforce change control on DNS/DHCP/IPAM edits.

validation_criteria:
  - A/PTR parity ≥ 99% in managed ranges.
  - DNS recursive p95 latency < 50ms on LAN.
  - DHCP scope utilization target 60–80% per pool.
  - CMDB device→service mapping completeness ≥ 98%.

device_identification_solutions:
  - Active Directory: query `dNSHostName`, `servicePrincipalName`, `msDS-AdditionalDnsHostName`.
  - WMI/CIM: `Win32_ComputerSystem.DNSHostName`, `Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration`.
  - NetBIOS as controlled fallback on legacy segments.
  - MAC correlation: ARP + switch CAM/LLDP + DHCP leases; OUI sanity checks.
  - DHCP reservations for infra class devices; static IPs for core with IPAM sync.

dns_optimization_techniques:
  - Secure dynamic updates; enable aging and scavenging; scheduled stale sweeps.
  - Maintain forward and reverse zones; automate PTR from IPAM.
  - TTL policy: infra 1–24h; apps 5–15m during migrations.
  - Coordinate secondaries via NOTIFY + IXFR; validate SOA/NS glue; check EDNS/DNSSEC.

database_integration_strategies:
  - Asset DB keys: device_uuid, fqdn, mgmt_ip; track owner, location, lifecycle.
  - Ingest from DHCP/DNS/switches/hypervisors; dedupe by UUID+MAC set.
  - Service→host mapping with labels and ports; record dependencies and SLOs.
  - Drift detection and event-driven reconciliation on state changes.

troubleshooting_procedures:
  - Connectivity ladder: link→VLAN→ARP/ND→gateway→DNS→TLS. Use ping/traceroute/tcping.
  - Name issues: stale PTR/FWD, duplicate A, split-DNS, cache poisoning suspicion.
  - Performance: TCAM/CPU, buffer drops, duplex mismatch, QoS misclass.
  - Security: rogue DHCP/DNS, NAC posture, mDNS containment on L3 boundaries.
