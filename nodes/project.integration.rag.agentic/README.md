# Project Integration RAG Agentic

Purpose: Provide a schema-compliant node for RAG + agentic integration. Matches `node.yaml` template exactly. No framework changes.

## Contents
- `node.yaml` — governance breadcrumbs per template.
- `constraints.yaml` — governance and framework restrictions.
- `knowledge_base.yaml` — curated domain expertise for RAG and agentic AI.
- `supplement_prompt.md` — operational prompt supplement.
- `README.md` — this file.

## Usage
- Commit this directory under `nodes/project.integration.rag.agentic/`.
- Keep existing repository files untouched.
- Use `knowledge_base.yaml` as reference for design and reviews.
- Use `supplement_prompt.md` to augment run-time prompts for systems that ingest this node.

## Notes
- Governance registry checksum pinned as provided.
- All URLs follow the raw/web pattern from the template.
