# Manufacturing Application Module Deployment - Node-Specific Context Injection

## Deployment Methodology Context
Use phased approaches with strict manufacturing controls.

### Phased Deployment Strategy
- Phase 0: Infrastructure validation and prerequisite completion (2–3 weeks)
- Phase 1: Pilot deployment on one production line (1–2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Limited rollout with monitoring and fallback readiness (2–3 weeks)
- Phase 3: Full deployment with performance and quality validation (1–2 weeks)
- Phase 4: Optimization, documentation, and lessons learned (1 week)

## Manufacturing-Specific Risk Mitigation
- Downtime must not exceed 4-hour windows  
- Rollback must be executable within 30 minutes  
- Equipment interface changes require simulated + live dual validation  
- Quality system integration must preserve audit trail integrity  
- Safety system modifications require compliance verification

## Critical Success Factors
- OT/IT network segmentation and security checks  
- Change management via operator training and supervisor engagement  
- Baseline metrics established pre-deployment and monitored post-go-live  
- Compliance alignment (FDA, ISO, industry safety standards)

## Deployment Team Structure
- Technical Lead: Application and integration
- Manufacturing Lead: Production impact and scheduling
- Quality Lead: Validation and audit oversight
- IT Lead: Infrastructure and security
- Training Lead: User adoption and change management

## Location Assessment Requirements
Every site assessment must cover:
- Network infrastructure capacity and redundancy
- Equipment integration compatibility
- Regulatory environment checks
- Workforce readiness and training needs
- Dependencies and migration requirements

## Rollback and Recovery
- Automated config backup before any changes
- Tested rollback procedures tied to each deployment phase
- Communication protocols for incident handling
- Production continuity plans
- Post-rollback review and corrective action

## Validation Requirements
- User acceptance in live-like production scenarios
- Performance under baseline and peak load
- Integration with MES, SCADA, ERP, historian systems
- Security validation including OT penetration testing
- Documentation and audit readiness

## Post-Deployment Support
- 24/7 support for 30 days after go-live
- Continuous monitoring and automated alerts
- Regular operator and supervisor feedback sessions
- Ongoing improvements based on KPIs
- Documentation updates reflecting actual usage
